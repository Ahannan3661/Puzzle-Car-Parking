# Gameplay instructions:-

Once the game has started, Click on the car that you want to move.
All the cars follow a set path and your goal is to get each car in a parking slot.
The cars can block eachother's path or collide when moving. You lose if there is a crash.
You also have a set number of moves and once you exhaust them, the game is lost.
The cars can also travel backwards so if you made a wrong move and you want the car to go back on it's path, click on the car again once it reaches the end of it's path.
